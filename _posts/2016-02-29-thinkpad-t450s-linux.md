When I got my T450s I was not quite sure, if and how good it would work with
linux.

I must say that I am pretty impressed:
Currently I am using Ubuntu Gnome 15.10.
Everything is working out of the box, except the 3-Finger-Gestures and
the Fingerprint-Reader.

- A Fix for the Fingerprint-Reader can easily be found [online](http://zecheru.com/thinkpad-fingerprint-ubuntu-14-04/?v=3a52f3c22ed6)
- For the 3-Finger-Gestures I did not yet find a fix, but even coming from a mac
I quickly ended up not really wanting to have it anymore.

##Interesting things about the hardware

I personally chose the T450s because it fits in the ultrabook-category while
still have features that now a days you usually only find in thicker and bigger
laptops:
- full size ethernet-jack
- SATA-HDD-Slot
- and on to of that a mSATA-Slot (if you are not using an LTE-Module)
- 1 SO-DIMM-Ram Slot
